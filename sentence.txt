Just one small positive thought in the morning can change your whole day
The mind is everything. What you think you become
It is never too late to be what you might have been
Do one thing every day that scares you
What you get by achieving your goals is not as important as what you become by achieving your goals
You are never too old to set another goal or to dream a new dream
You have brains in your head. You have feet in your shoes. You can steer yourself any direction you choose
Believe you can and you're halfway there
The only limit to our realization of tomorrow will be our doubts of today
It always seems impossible until it's done
